# Frontmatter Banner (Obsidian Plugin)

Add a visually stunning banner image to any note by specifying the image path in your noteâ€™s frontmatter. The plugin automatically renders the banner at the top of your note, both in reading and editing mode, using efficient CSS. Banner position and height are fully customizable.

---

## Features

- **Automatic banner images** for notes with a `banner` property in YAML frontmatter.
- **Works in both reading (preview) and editing (live preview) modes.**
- **Customizable banner position:** use the `bannerFocus` frontmatter key for fine-tuned image alignment (supports CSS background-position syntax).
- **Adjustable banner height:** set a global height via the plugin settings tab.
- **No need for manual callouts or markdown image embeds.**
- **Efficient and unobtrusive:** only affects notes with a `banner` property.
- **CSS stored in a separate `style.css` file** for easy tweaking and theming.
- **Choose banner image location:** Toggle in plugin settings to select if banners are loaded from the note's folder or always from the root attachments folder.
